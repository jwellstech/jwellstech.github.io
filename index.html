                <h2>Computers</h2>
                <p>I've spent my entire life dealing with computers from hardware to software. I have a large interest in building hardware and have put together about 7 desktop computers now, including my own.</p>
                <p>I've grown up playing video games and they're a big hobby of mine. I have over 200 games in my Steam library and my favorite games are probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Rain">Heavy Rain</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange">Life is Strange</a>. The game you're most likely to see me playing right now is Blizzard's <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a>.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Aside from just playing video games I also love programming and have written some games/programs with friends and peers. The two publicly available programs I'm most proud of are <a href="http://github.com/jwellstech/zombiegame">Zombiegame</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jwellstech/boggle">Boggle</a>.</p>
                <p>Programming is not just a career or work for me, but also a hobby. I've written countless amounts of code just for personal use or even for fun. You can find my personal github <a href="http://github.com/jwellstech">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>Music really envelopes my life. I've been a pianist since I was in the 2nd grade and often play as a good way to relax. No matter what I'm doing, you can usually find me with something playing in the background.</p>

                <p>Skateboarding wasn't really a part of my life until 2016 when I got my first skateboard from my uncle. Although I'm not that good at tricks, I really enjoy riding around both alone and with friends. </p>
